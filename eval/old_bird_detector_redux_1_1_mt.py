"""
Module containing multi-threshold reimplementations of Old Bird Tseep and
Thrush detectors.

The implementations in this module run detectors for multiple thresholds
at once for detector evaluations. The implementations eliminate redundant
computation that would be performed if the single-threshold detectors of
the Vesper `old_bird_detector_redux_1_1` module were simply run repeatedly
with different thresholds.

The detectors can be run either with or without the post-processing
implemented in the original detectors, including the merging of overlapping
clips and the suppression of frequent clips.

The original Old Bird detectors were implemented in the late 1990's by
Steve Mitchell and Bill Evans using the MathWorks' Simulink and Real-Time
Workshop. They were based on an algorithm developed in 1994 by Harold Mills
at the Biocaoustics Research Program of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The
reimplementations are writen in Python and make use of NumPy and SciPy.

The original detectors ran only on Windows, could process only input
sampled at 22050 hertz, and could process only one file at a time on a
given computer.  The reimplementations remove all of these restrictions.

    Reimplementation of Old Bird transient detector.
    
    The original Old Bird Tseep and Thrush detectors were implemented in
    the late 1990's by Steve Mitchell and Bill Evans using the MathWorks'
    Simulink and Real-Time Workshop. The detectors were based on a transient
    detection algorithm developed in 1994 by Harold Mills at the Bioacoustics
    Research Program of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The Tseep and Thrush
    detectors used the same basic transient detection algorithm, but with
    different settings.
    
    The Old Bird detectors had a number of limitations. For example, they
    ran only on Windows, they assumed an input sample rate of 22050 hertz,
    and they could only run on one input file on a given computer at once.
    This reimplementation removes those limitations.
    
    An instance of this class operates on a single audio channel. It has a
    `detect` method that takes a NumPy array of samples. The method can be
    called repeatedly with consecutive sample arrays. The `complete_detection`
    method should be called after the final call to the `detect` method.
    During detection, each time the detector detects a clip it notifies
    a listener by invoking the listener's `process_clip` method. The
    `process_clip` method must accept two arguments, the start index and
    length of the detected clip.
    
    See the `_TSEEP_SETTINGS` and `_THRUSH_SETTINGS` objects above for
    settings that make a `_Detector` behave much like the original Old
    Bird Tseep and Thrush detectors in the sense that it will detect
    most of the same clips. The `TseepDetector` and `ThrushDetector`
    classes of this module subclass the `_Detector` class with fixed
    settings, namely `_TSEEP_SETTINGS` AND `_THRUSH_SETTINGS`,
    respectively.
    
    This detector reimplementation was developed and tested initially in
    the GitHub repository https://github.com/HaroldMills/Vesper-Tseep-Thrush,
    and then copied to the Vesper repository for further development and
    testing. See the README of the Vesper-Tseep-Thrush repository for more
    about the reimplementation effort.
